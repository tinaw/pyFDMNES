(This is short. For further information see http://docs.python.org/install/)


First: EDIT THE setup.cfg !


Then start a command line and change to this directory.
You can also use an interactive python command line (ipython).
In this case, the command ``python`` has to be replaced by ``run`` in
the following.

Then:

1) Compile the program. Use one of the following options:
    
    i) by default the multi-core prozessing option is enabled
    
        python setup.py build -f
    

2) If no errors but only warnings have occured copy into packages folder:
    
    i) for current user only:
    
        python setup.py install --user
    
    ii) for all users:
    
        python setup.py install


    iii) if you want to create an inplace module which only works in
         the local folder, you can use:
    
        python setup.py build_ext -f -i
